# RMMS
RainMeadow Mod Sorter is a utility program designed to allow for easy sorting of the RainMeadow lobby allowed, banned, and high-impact mods, written in C#. This version of RMMS uses a text-based UI. Don't worry, I took time making it look decent!

**Some History**

Initially, this program was going to be written in [Lua](https://lua.org), but after trouble with getting [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) to work with [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/), it was decided that this project would be written in C# instead. A good friend of mine helped me understand all the requirements of a mod sorter for Rain Meadow, as I am not as familiar with the mod. I ended up writing this in two days, enjoying my summer break. This program was actually my first ever program written in C# (I litterally mean first- this was before a _Hello World!_), so I definitely am more proud of it than I should be.
